this generates a profile for a team

1) Create a package.json!x
2) Determine what Libraries we need to use (inquirer), (jest)x
3) How do I download a library as a Dev Dependency on package.json? (JEST)x
4) How do I download a library as a dependency on package.json (inquirer)?x

5) To create a folder structure with __tests__, dist, lib, src, .gitignore, index.js, and package.jsonx

6) Let's create the test files as the README recommends. (One for each task Employee, Engineer, Intern, & Manager)x

7) TDD convention -> We write the tests on what the application needs to do, then write the Javascript file, then see if we pass the test. 

8) WHY DO WE HAVE 4 TEST FILES?x
    => Because we want to separate the Javascript files based on the CLASSES.x 
9) Employee, Engineer, Intern, Manager JS files. x
10) Is an Engineer an Employee?x
10b) Is an Intern an Employee (YES)x
10c) Is a Manager an Employee (YES)x

11) NOW let's try to use our classes to run the inquirer library in our command line/terminal.
12) Inquirer ask to create a manager, add IDs for a manager, add email for manager, and once that is done, HOW DO WE PUSH THIS INFORMATION INTO AN HTML TEMPLATE?x
13) .then(answers => {is there a way to store the user's inputs into an array and PASS THEM INTO THE PAGE-TEMPLATE?})
